BundleTransformer.Hogan contains one translator-adapter - `HoganTranslator` (supports the [Hogan](https://twitter.github.io/hogan.js) version 3.0.2).
This adapter makes translation of Mustache templates to JS code.
Also contains the `HoganAssetHandler` debugging HTTP handler, which is responsible for text output of translated Mustache asset.

As a JS engine is used the [JavaScript Engine Switcher](https://github.com/Taritsyn/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher) library.
For correct working of this module, you need to install one of the following NuGet packages:

 * [JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.ChakraCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.ChakraCore)
 * [JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.Jint](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.Jint)
 * [JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.Msie](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.Msie)
 * [JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8)

After installing the packages, you will need to [register the default JS engine](https://github.com/Taritsyn/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher/wiki/Registration-of-JS-engines).
